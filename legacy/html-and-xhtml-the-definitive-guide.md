## Notes

XHTML: An XML markup language that mirrors or extends HTML.  
Strunk and White: Authors of "The Elements of Style", a very influential style guide for American English, written in 1959.  

Element types and tags are technically different things according to the standard. The contents of a tag, called attributes, affect the element type's contents.

subsume: To take up into or under, as particular under universal.  
nadir: The lowest point; the time of greatest depression.  
abortive: Failing in its effect; miscarrying; unsuccessful.  

> XML provides a way to create new, standards-based markup languages that don't take an act of the W3C to implement. 
For nontraditional content like musical notation or mathematical expressions.  

> The paradox in all this is that even the HTML 4.01 standard is not the definitive resource.

Common Gateway Interface (CGI): An interface specification that enables web servers to execute an external program to process HTTP user requests. The external programs are called CGI scripts. URLs denote CGI scripts.  
CD-ROM: a read-only optical media format that uses CDs to store data.  
Maverick: A young cow or bull that has not been branded and is unclaimed or wild.  

meteoric: Flashing; transient and brilliant; like a meteor.
intranet: A private network using the same software and protocols as the Internet.
extranet: Network that uses the Internet to provide services but restricts access to members.

The main benefits of HTML over existing Internet technologies were that it unified pictures, sounds and text into one documentand enabled hypertext linking, where documents reference other documents.  
Hypertext: Text displayed on a computer display with references to other text that the reader can immediately access.

> less rummaging, more productive time online.

netiquette: Internet etiquette, prohibiting such things as spam email, commonly upheld in the Internet's old times.

Domain name registration used to be handled by a nonprofit organization called InterNIC, but now all organizations and individuals must go through a for-profit company to register a domain name, except US government-related domains.

Internet newsgroup: Refers to a Usenet newsgroup, a repository in the Usenet system for messages posted from users in different locations using the Internet. They are discussion groups, not news publishers.

The comp.infosystems.www newsgroup hierarchy is devoted to the Web, includeng .authoring.html and .authoring.images.

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): Defines standards for Web-related technology including HTTP, CSS, and XML.
Internet Engineering Task Force (IEFT): Defines all of the technology of the Internet via official documents known as Request for Comments (RFCS).

> HTML is the black sheep in the family of document markup languages.

HTML was based on Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a markup metalanguage originally intended to be the one tool that all document elements were created with. Like SGML, XML is a formal markup metalanguage that uses select features of SGML to define HTML-like markup languages. XML is a simplified subset of SGML.

HTML is *not* a document formatting tool!

reconstitute: To rebuild, or change the organization of.  
eschew: To shun; to avoid as something wrong.  
decry: To blame clamorously; to censure as faulty, mean or worthless.  

XML modules allow you to add new features to XHTML documents in a standardized way. For example, the MathML module provides markup elements for math equations. XHTML is itself composed of XML modules.

Word processor: A computer program for inputting, editing, formatting, and displaying text.  
Desktop publishing: The creation of documents such as newsletters, brochures, books and web pages using dedicated software on a personal computer.  

Freeware: Software (usually proprietary) distributed at no monetary cost to the user. This doesn't describe the type of license the software uses.  
Shareware: Proprietary software that is initially shared by the owner for trial use at no cost, often with incomplete functionality until the user pays.

Some HTML tags don't have an end tag, and some end tags are optional.

The <html> tag is required by the HTML and XHTML standards, but optional in practice.

The <frameset> tag (now deprecated) creates a multi-pane layout, where each frame displays a separate HTML document.

The <head> tag defines the documents header.  
Several header tags define how the document fits into a document collection and into the larger scheme of the Web.

An HTML comment has special-case start and end tags, which are <!-- and -->.  

Instead of physical text style tags, use content-related text style tags which attach meaning to the text passage.

A character entity starts with an ampersand, followed by its name, and terminated with a semicolon. Instead of the name, you can use a pound sign followed by its position number in the Unicode character table. The browser displays the character *if* it exists in the user's font.

Except in special circumstances, browsers ignore leading and trailing spaces, newlines, and sometimes also multiple consecutive spaces.

The <div>, <p>, and <br> tags are the most rudimentary ways to structure your document. All three break the text flow, which restarts on a new line.  
The <div> and <p> tags define elemental regions of the document and text, respectively.

Uniform Resource Locator (URL): The unique address assigned to a document or resource on the internet.  
The format is protocol://server_domain_name/pathname, where **protocol** is the software that the browser and server use to communicate and **pathname** is the document's name preceded by the hierarchy of directory names where the file is stored.  
For relative URLs, the browser fills in any missing portions of the URL with respective parts of the current document's base URL (everything up to the document name). For example, the URL price_list.html is assumed to be located in the same directory as the current document.

Image files are the only multimedia that standard HTML and XHTML have an explicit provision for displaying inline within a document. That's because the industry has reached a consensus on image file formats, namely GIF, PNG, and JPEG. Browsers have built in decoders for those image types.

The browser places an image into the text flow as if it were a special character. By default it aligns the bottom of the image with the bottom of the line of text, but this can be changed with the CSS align property to the top, middle or bottom.
