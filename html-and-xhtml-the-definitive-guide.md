## Notes

XHTML: An XML markup language that mirrors or extends HTML.  
Strunk and White: Authors of "The Elements of Style", a very influential style guide for American English, written in 1959.  

Element types and tags are technically different things according to the standard. The contents of a tag, called attributes, affect the element type's contents.

subsume: To take up into or under, as particular under universal.  
nadir: The lowest point; the time of greatest depression.  
abortive: Failing in its effect; miscarrying; unsuccessful.  

> XML provides a way to create new, standards-based markup languages that don't take an act of the W3C to implement. 
For nontraditional content like musical notation or mathematical expressions.  

> The paradox in all this is that even the HTML 4.01 standard is not the definitive resource.

Common Gateway Interface (CGI): An interface specification that enables web servers to execute an external program to process HTTP user requests. The external programs are called CGI scripts. URLs denote CGI scripts.  
CD-ROM: a read-only optical media format that uses CDs to store data.  
Maverick: A young cow or bull that has not been branded and is unclaimed or wild.
